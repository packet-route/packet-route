Following all the instructions, we trained an AI model carefully, and still got weird results. We did exactly that while teaching a Teachable Machine model to recognize whether a squat was correct or incorrect. What looked like a simple machine learning project rapidly turned into a lesson about how AI actually learns and how easy it is to confuse it.

The results revealed much more than whether someone squatted correctly.

AI only learns what you show it. Our project used Google’s Teachable Machine to classify squat form into two categories: Correct and Incorrect. We collected 140 images for the correct squat class and 249 images for the incorrect squat class to train the model. Because our dataset had a data imbalance favoring the incorrect class, the model was already predisposed to look for flaws rather than standard form. 

At first, it seemed like more images would instantly create a more advanced model. However, we learned that the quality and consistency of the images matter just as much. In addition, if the images contain distractions, the AI may learn patterns that have nothing to do with the actual activity. 

Our squat-classification project showed that building an AI model is not just about training software, but about teaching with high quality examples. This machine learning experience showed that data testing and collection are more important than the training process itself. 

As AI becomes even more common in fitness, healthcare, and everyday scenarios, it is crucial to understand what a model learns and how it is built.
